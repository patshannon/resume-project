            My Story</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            <p className="about-info">
                My career path so far has provided me with a vast array of unique skills and tools that allows me to be marketable in various industries.
                Becoming a commercial pilot wasn't easy,  many hours of disciplined training and ongoing examination has led me to where I am today.  
                At the same time I was training to become a pilot I was also completing my Bachelor of Science where I specialized in Environmental Science.   
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
                After completing my BSc. and my pilot training I became a flight instructor where I mainly focused on teaching students from China how to fly.  
                During my time as an instructor I learned to love teaching and was one of the many great parts of the job.  
                I found out that I was a natural teacher and had a higher level of patience then most and I would get assigned to work with the students who were struggling to progress in their training. 
                Eventually I ended up in a management role where I was tasked with the responsibility of managing a team of flight instructors.  
                I offered my training and teaching expertise to them and made sure everything was being done to promote a successful training experience for the student.  
                I also developed my data analysis skills by analyzing data to figure out what areas of training needed improvements.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
                From instructing I then progressed into more traditional pilot jobs.  I have flown medivac missions (air ambulance) all over the Maritime's in varies weather conditions.  
                At my current job I have flown all over Eastern Canada and into the United States for an airline operator.  Both these jobs have allowed me to enhance the skills needed to be a great team member.   
                My communication, CRM(crew resource management), customer service as well as my technical pilot skills have been expanded as these skills are utilized on every flight.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
                Following my passion for technology and design I recently completed an online course in Web Development.  
                Focusing on HTML / CSS / Bootsrap / Javascript / REACT / NODE.js as well as database control I have gained the required skills to start my journey towards being a professional Full Stack Web Developer.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
                In my spare time I enjoy golfing, playing guitar, building computers, photography, exercising and learning new things.
