Fresh Full Stack Web Developer working on building up my portfolio.

Focusing on REACT implementation

I'll be implementing cool features and components as I grow and learn more.

I am interested in learning more and willing to collaborate on websites / web apps

Looking to gain more experience working with databases and account creation (authentication / security).



Cheers,
P
